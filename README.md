- 📝 I am currently the CTO and Chief Architect at GladCloud, where I lead the development of the [Trade Marketing Platform](https://www.github.com/gladcloud/). The platform enables Big Brands to provide independent Trade Customers & Groups with customised advertising that they can publish on their own Social Media pages.
- 🚶 In my spare time, I enjoy exploring new technologies and experimenting with different programming languages, as I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn.
- 💬 I have deep experience with [Azure Architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/), [Cloud Adoption Framework](https://github.com/Azure/caf-terraform-landingzones), and [Well-Architected Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/). I enjoy working on complex projects and excel at turning chaos into order.
- 📫 You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrumsta/) to learn more about me and my work.
- ❗ Fun fact: I have a rare personality type called Mediator (INFP), which makes me naturally quiet, open-minded, and imaginative. I approach everything I do with a caring and creative mindset.
