- 📝 I am currently the CTO and Chief Architect at GladCloud, where I lead the development of the [Trade Marketing Platform](https://www.github.com/gladcloud/). The platform enables Big Brands to provide independent Trade Customers & Groups with customised advertising that they can publish on their own Social Media pages.
- 🚶 In my spare time, I enjoy exploring new technologies and experimenting with different programming languages, as I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn.
- ❗ Fun fact: I have a rare personality type called Mediator (INFP), which makes me naturally quiet, open-minded, and imaginative. I approach everything I do with a caring and creative mindset.
