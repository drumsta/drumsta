- 📝 I am currently working at GladCloud, focusing on the [Trade Marketing Platform](https://www.github.com/gladcloud/). It's an exciting project that I'm thrilled to be a part of!
- 🚶 In my spare time, I enjoy diving deep into the [Go](https://go.dev/) language and exploring the potential of [OpenAI](https://chat.openai.com/) technology.
- 📈 While I'm working on those projects, I'm also developing my own garage project called [Backtestor](https://github.com/backtestor).
- 🔭 In 2022, I gained experience with various front-end technologies, such as [Astro](https://astro.build/), [AMP](https://amp.dev/), [PWA](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/), and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). As a result, I developed a hobby project called [Companion for Train Simulator](https://github.com/drumsta/companion-for-ts) - ꉣꁲꁍꏹꑄꉣꏹꏹꂡ ꒐ꋊꌚꂑꁍꍩꋖꌚ 100.
- 💬 Please feel free to reach out to me about [Azure Architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/), [Cloud Adoption Framework](https://github.com/Azure/caf-terraform-landingzones), [Well-Architected Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/), or any other complex project with endless opportunities - I excel at turning chaos into order.
- 📫 You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrumsta/) to learn more about me and my work.
- ❗ Fun fact: I have a rare personality type called Mediator (INFP), which makes me naturally quiet, open-minded, and imaginative. I approach everything I do with a caring and creative mindset.
