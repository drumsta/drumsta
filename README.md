- 📝 I am currently the CTO and Chief Architect at GladCloud, where I lead the development of the [Trade Marketing Platform](https://www.github.com/gladcloud/). The platform enables Big Brands to provide independent Trade Customers & Groups with customised advertising that they can publish on their own Social Media pages. I'm passionate about building products that make a difference in people's lives!
- 🚶 In my spare time, I enjoy exploring new technologies and experimenting with different programming languages. Recently, I've been diving deep into the [Go](https://go.dev/) language and exploring the potential of [OpenAI](https://chat.openai.com/) technology. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn.
- 🔭 In 2022, I gained experience with a variety of front-end technologies, including [Astro](https://astro.build/), [AMP](https://amp.dev/), [PWA](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/), and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). I used this experience to develop a hobby project called [Companion for Train Simulator](https://github.com/drumsta/companion-for-ts), which provides train enthusiasts with a companion app that enhances their virtual train driving experience.
- 💬 I have deep experience with [Azure Architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/), [Cloud Adoption Framework](https://github.com/Azure/caf-terraform-landingzones), and [Well-Architected Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/). I enjoy working on complex projects and excel at turning chaos into order. If you have a project that requires a thoughtful and creative approach, feel free to reach out to me!
- 📫 You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrumsta/) to learn more about me and my work. I'm always open to new connections and opportunities to collaborate.
- ❗ Fun fact: I have a rare personality type called Mediator (INFP), which makes me naturally quiet, open-minded, and imaginative. I approach everything I do with a caring and creative mindset.
- 🎉 Thank you for visiting my page - I hope you enjoy my contributions and projects!
